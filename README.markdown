Toggle Function Keys for OS X (10.6)
==============

This is a modified version of an AppleScript from [Macsteps](http://macsteps.com/blog/tips/how-to-quickly-toggle-your-keyboards-function-keys/), updated to support OS X 10.6 and to put up a Growl notification with the new status. There's also a Download available bundled as a shiny application, so no fancy script menu nonsense is necessary - just run the app.

This will only work in English at the moment due to its reliance on GUI scripting.
